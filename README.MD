# Pokédex Web App

A Pokédex-style web application built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that consumes the PokéAPI. Browse and search Pokémon, view stats, and explore evolution chains through a clean, responsive interface.

## Features

- Browse the original 151 Pokémon
- Search Pokémon by name
- View Pokémon stats with visual bars
- View Pokémon types and sprites
- Explore evolution chains
- Pokédex-inspired modal design
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Bootstrap)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- PokéAPI

## How It Works

- Fetches Pokémon data from the PokéAPI
- Dynamically renders Pokémon cards and modal views
- Uses additional API calls to load evolution chain data
- Handles invalid searches with basic error feedback

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser
- Internet connection (for PokéAPI requests)

### Run locally

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Misto0o/Poke-Index.git
   cd Poke-Index
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click the file), or serve the folder and view it at http://localhost:

   - Using the VS Code Live Server extension: click "Open with Live Server".
   - Or with Python (if installed):

     ```powershell
     python -m http.server 8000
     # then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
     ```

That’s it — no build step required.

## Future Improvements

- Pokédex-style UI redesign
- Previous / Next Pokémon navigation
- Pokémon cries and sound effects
- Move and ability details
- Offline support with caching
